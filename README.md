**The Code Keepers’ Paradox**

_In the beginning, there was a single line._

And from that line emerged chaos, then order, then chaos again. But the wise coder knows: the loop never ends.

Legend speaks of a hidden function, buried deep within this repo. A function so elegant, so efficient, it rewrites itself every time it is invoked. Find it, and you will understand the true meaning of recursion.

**Clues to guide you:**

- The key lies between the stars (\* \* \*)
- Beware of the silent letters in the comments.
- The console never lies, but it does hide.
- You’ll know you’re close when you see the shadow of the variable that was never declared.
